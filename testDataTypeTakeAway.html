    <h3>int [1million]</h3>
    <p>
        for (long i = 0; i < R10M; i++)
        {
        Array[i] = rand() % RAND;
        }
        Every time I want to store 10.000.000 numbers in array my program crashed (Eclipse).
        I even tryed Visual Studio and it crashed to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason your program crashes is that you are using an "automatic" variable, which is allocated on the "stack." The stack is much more limited in size than the "heap" typically, so using automatic
        variables of such large size may result in a...wait for it...
        Instead, try this:

        int* array = new int[10000000];
        Then after using it:

        delete[] array;
    </p>
    <h3>Sizeof and v1.size()</h3>
    <p>
        Use the vector::size() method: i < v.size().

        The sizeof operator returns the size in bytes of the object or expression at compile time, which is constant for a std::vector.
